Hello world,

My name is Linh and I pretend to be an engineer.
I spent my 20s studying and doing non-engineering stuff, which I deeply regret.


Now from my 30s, I start my journey in IT engineering, start by creating myself little tools.


I enjoy discovering how things work and putting pieces of knowledge together to create things.

My works:
- peew.me: a screenshot tool that helps you conveniently take screenshots
